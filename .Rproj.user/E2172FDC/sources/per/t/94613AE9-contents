I\'m a Moore-Sloan Faculty Fellow in the [Center for Data Science](https://cds.nyu.edu/) at New York University. Before joining NYU, I held postdoctoral positions at Northwestern University and Yale University. I received my PhD from [Nuffield College, University of Oxford](https://www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk/).

My work focuses on discrimination and inequality in criminal justice, with a particular interest in policing. I also work on program evaluation. I\'ve studied the effects of procedural justice training on police behavior and the impact of violence reduction programs on gunshot victimization. All of my work draws heavily on causal inference in observational settings.

At NYU, I teach [Responsible Data Science](https://dataresponsibly.github.io/rds/) and [Data Science for Everyone](https://cds.nyu.edu/ds-for-everyone/).
