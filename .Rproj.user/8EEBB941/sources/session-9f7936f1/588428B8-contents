# socr

<!-- badges: start -->
[![Lifecycle: experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#experimental)
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of socr is to provide a general framework for modeling tracking and event data in soccer. 

## Installation

Install the development version of socr:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("george-wood/socr")
```

## Usage

An example using the [Metrica Sports sample tracking data](https://github.com/metrica-sports/sample-data):

```{r example}
library(socr)

data(metrica_tracking)

# coerce to a tracking object
trk <- as_tracking(metrica_tracking)
print(trk)

# coerce to a position object
p <- as_position(trk[time == 10])
print(p, n = 5)

# calculate displacement between players
displacement(p,
             from = c("player1", "player2"),
             to = c("player1", "player2", "ball"))
```
